#4 - Graphics Settings

Finally we get to talk about graphics settings.
For those with unconsistent or low FPS, this section is for you!
Getting some things out of the way: TF2 wasn't meant to be played with the worst possible look, but it wasn't supposed to be the next-gen in graphics quality either, it's something in between the two.
If your PC just isn't good enough to play TF2 on the default lowest settings (lowest settings in the GUI menu), then the best option, if you have the means, is to upgrade (from) your current PC.
That said, if you don't have the means to upgrade your PC, buy a new one or you just don't think It's worth getting a new one, there might be a solution for you.

##4.1 - Chris's Configs

For now this section will be short, I'll just tell you to use [Chris's Configs](https://github.com/tf2configs/tf2configs "Chris's Configs GitHub Repo"), but I plan to add more detail in the (not so near) future.
You will really have to read through his files because settings may have different results in different systems and so, the settings that work on my system may not work (the same way) in yours.
The installer script included in his repo only works on \*Nix OSes with shell.
In Windows what you have to do is pick the config file you want, modify it so that it fits your system, add the _.cfg_ extension and put it on your _cfg_ folder.

##4.2 - Alternatives

Alternatively, you can search the [TFTV Forums](http://www.teamfortress.tv/forum/8/customization "TeamFortress.TV Forums") for configs made by other players.
