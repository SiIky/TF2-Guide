##1.2 - More commands:
These TF2Wiki and Valve pages have a bigger list (as one would expect) that will give you a taste of what's comming in the configuring section.

Remember that knowledge is power. If you know how to do something, you don't need anyone to do it for you, you'll be able to do it yourself! (and even better i must say)
