#5 - Customizing

There isn't much to be said here, just HUDs and crosshairs.

##5.1 - Getting a HUD

[HUDs.TF](http://huds.tf/ "HUDs TF") is the way to go. Or just ask around which HUDs other people use and like, that works too!

_MrSlin_ has made a [vid](https://youtu.be/7lTpJu79T-4 "TF2 - How to Pick a HUD - Finding One that Suits Your Needs by MrSlin") showing off some of the most popular HUDs.

If you can't decide between so many HUDs give    [RaysHUD by _Rays_](https://github.com/raysfire/rayshud "RaysHUD GitHub repo") a try!

There's also a big thread on the TFTV forums with a lot of custom HUDs [here](http://www.teamfortress.tv/post/681/collection-of-custom-huds#1 "Collection of Custom HUDs - TFTV").

##5.2 - Crosshairs

I don't feel the need for custom crosshairs like the _Konr Wings_ or others and so I can't give any info (for now) on this.
I used [TF2 Mate](http://clugu.com/tf2mate/ "TF2 Mate by compton") to configure my crosshairs (simple ones, that come with the game, like the + , X , O , etc), for each class and weapon slot. You can also set to turn viewmodels on or off for each slot.
_NOTE: The crosshairs for the spy on TF2 Mate are bugged. It will always be a white dot, independent of which crosshair you choose._

##5.3 - Editing your HUD

It comes that time when you don't want a custom HUD made by someone else or there's that little thing in your favourite HUD that you just hate(!) and wanna change it. Fear not! Here's a list of (hopefully) helpful links on editing your HUD:
