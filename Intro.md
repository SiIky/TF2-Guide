#Guide of All things TF2
This is a guide for everyone! Those who just clicked the install button and those who play the game for a long time (or not so long) and want/need to learn a few more things about it. I'm aiming for it to have a bunch of info on configuring and customizing TF2 to your liking and improving your experience, starting with basic commands and essential knowledge and going into _advanced_ stuff like scripts and such.
