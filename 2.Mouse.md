#2 - Mouse Settings
First, you should know there isn't a miracle way to improve your aim, so this section is more about letting you know of (better) ways to practice your aim.
##2.1 - Recommended:
These settings are widely used and recommended by Comp TF2 players and the grandfathers of pro gaming.
I say recommended because it really comes down to personal preference. Some Comp TF2 players (like kaidus) use different settings. BUT they're here for a reason, in general they should help improve your aim and consistency over time!

* sensitivity "x" // (Integer bigger than 0) - this isn't really a recommendation, it's just a part of mouse settings and probably the most important command
* m_rawinput "b" // (0/1) 1 recomended
* m_customaccel "b" // (0/1) 0 recomended
* m_customaccel_exponent "x" // 1
* m_customaccel_max "b" //
* m_customaccel_scale "b" //
* m_filter "b" // (0/1)
* m_forward "b" //
* m_mouseaccel1 "x" //
* m_mouseaccel2 "x" //
* m_mousespeed "x" //
* m_pitch "x" //
* m_side "x" //
* m_yaw "x" //

##2.2 - Finding the Right Sensitivity:
There are many ways to find the sensitivity you're more comfortable with, like tracking a fixed spot while moving, at different distances, while you adjust the sensitivity. Here I'll link some guides that i've read/watched and other people suggested. I must point out that, being TF2 an FPS, heavily aiming focused, most "sensitivity guides" for other FPS games should also apply for TF2 (and vice-versa). Although, if you're comming from other FPS games and care for your aim you probably already know this.

Let's get to the guides:
* ["Aiming" by RaZieL](https://http://www.bulletz.org/et/aimingbyraz.zip "Aiming by RaZieL"):
This is a good guide made by a(n) (ex-)professional Wolf:ET player, before he left the W:ET pro scene. He speaks about some subjects that apply to W:ET only, like strategies and personal playstyle, but you can pass that. It helped me to _improve_, be more _consistent_ and get more _comfortable_ with aiming - even though im quite shite :/ In case you don't trust the link - for w.e. reason - or it doesn't work anymore, i should have a copy on my PC so just msg me on Steam and i'll send you a copy of the .zip file.
* [CS:GO Finding your sensitivity - by adreN ](https://youtu.be/RwT5fXEloxg "CS:GO Finding your sensitivity - by adreN"): Finding your sensitivity, depending on personal preference aswell as context/situation, by a professional CS:GO player, from the Team Liquid.

##2.3 - Actually Improving your Aim:
Read/watch and follow those guides and...
...**Practice, practice, practice**... Do some _MGE_ (My Gaming Edge), _DM_ (DeathMatch), _1vs1_/_1vs2_/_1vs3_/... Just play, in general. You won't get anywhere if you _think_ you're doing it right, only if you actually **DO** it right! And the only way to know if you're doing it right is by playing!
This might sound like a cliché, but after you practice for a while, go practice some more!
Jumping (solly and demo) also helped me getting more comfortable moving my mouse and aiming at awkward places, so if you don't jump already, try it out.
